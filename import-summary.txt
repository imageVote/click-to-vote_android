ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .htaccess
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* nbandroid\
* nbandroid\private.properties
* private\
* private\cache\
* private\cache\retriever\
* private\cache\retriever\catalog.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\answers-1.3.6.jar => app\libs\answers-1.3.6.jar
* libs\crashlytics-2.5.5.jar => app\libs\crashlytics-2.5.5.jar
* libs\digits-1.9.2.jar => app\libs\digits-1.9.2.jar
* libs\fabric-1.3.9.jar => app\libs\fabric-1.3.9.jar
* libs\twitter-core-1.6.2.jar => app\libs\twitter-core-1.6.2.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
